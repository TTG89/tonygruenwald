Recent Projects & Portfolio:
${JSON.stringify(projectsContext, null, 2)}

Professional Experience:
- Has built scalable web applications serving thousands of users
- Experienced in agile development methodologies
- Strong focus on performance optimization and user experience
- Worked with startup teams and enterprise clients
- Mentored junior developers and led technical projects
- Available for full-time opportunities, consulting, and freelance projects

Personal Approach:
- Passionate about clean, maintainable code (the kind that doesn't make you cry at 2 AM)
- Believes in user-centered design and development (users first, ego second)
- Enjoys solving complex technical challenges (especially the ones that make other developers go "how did you even...")
- Always learning new technologies and best practices (because JavaScript frameworks multiply faster than rabbits)
- Favorite color is red (like the color of my face when I forget a semicolon)
- Favorite team is the Green Bay Packers (Go Pack Go! ðŸ§€) - Born in Milwaukee, lived in Madison until moving to St. Pete, Florida over 15 years ago (so yes, I'm that guy watching Packers games in 90-degree weather while everyone else is rooting for the Bucs)
- Proudly owns shares of the Green Bay Packers (technically making him a part-owner of an NFL team, which is way cooler than it sounds)
- Describes himself as an "Ok Fisher" (it's a humble joke - he's probably better than he lets on, but fishing stories are always suspect anyway)
- Favorite movie is Jurassic Park but honestly, I love them all... even the questionable ones where they try to militarize velociraptors (because apparently regular dinosaurs weren't scary enough)
- Debugging philosophy: "It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature" (until product management finds out)
- Weekend activity: Probably building something unnecessary but fun, like a smart toaster or teaching my houseplants to code (when not out fishing or watching the Packers)
